On the roadmap:
	-Implement space travel system
		--many rocket parts, each one expensive, better parts allows further travel
	-Implement magic system
    	--earth, fire, water, air mana
	-Make dialog pages dynamic with upgrades changing position when others are bought, instead of having each upgrade on a given page
	-add more buildings/research/skills/perks
	-random events
	-achievement system
	
needed to get to where I was before:
	-implementations of buildings and research
	-reset
	-skills
	-production overviews

Required before release:
*****get to previous progress with javascript

***Add a tutorial

Next in implementation:
	
***Add a new progress bar whenever the old one reaches maximum speed
    -Multiple tiers, replace bar and tool upgrade with the new bar and tool upgrade
	
*Implement manufacturing system
    -Come up with names for components
        -
    -Come up with ways to obtain basic components
        -Always get some when the progress bar fills
        -Chance to get some whenever the progress bar fills
		-Separate progress bars for other components
	
*Implement prestige system, allow players to hard reset with a bonus, require a ton of singularities to unlock

Last thing: Playtesting to look for bugs and set costs for upgrades
